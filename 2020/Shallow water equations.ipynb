    "# Shallow water equations and potential vorticity\n",

    "The complete set of equations that describe atmospheric motions is too complex to easily derive important characteristics of large-scale atmospheric flow. A much simpler system that carries many of the same properties as the atmospheric flow are the shallow water equations. Carl-Gustaf Rossby showed the concept first for ocean currents. Later it turned out that this set of equations is a very good predictor for the evolution of the 500 hPa geopotential surface, and therefore can be used to do weather forecasting. Furthermore, he showed that this already simple set of equations can be simplified even more by introducing the concept of potential vorticity.\n",
